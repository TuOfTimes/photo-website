I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to study abroad during my second year of university. While selecting a foreign university to study at may sound like a tall task, it only took me a few minutes to decide that I wanted to go to Singapore.

My parents met in Singapore while pursuing theire Masters degrees, and I was born at the Singapore General Hospital in 1998. However, I have no recollection of the city, as I moved away when I was quite young. My personal connection to the city was very strong, and on top of that, the city boasted one of the best education systems in the world. 

After spending a semester in Singapore, I must say that the experience far exceeded my expectations. After speaking to friends who went on exchange elsewhere (mostly in Europe), it seems that Singapore is far superior. Here's why.

Due to its history, Singapore has a habit of being brutally pragmatic - everything is done with a purpose and nothing is overlooked. As a result, the public transportation system is excellent and extremely affordable, and most locations are usually no more than half an hour away. By public transportation, one can explore the countryside, shop at Orchard Road, and people watch in the Downtown area. 

Everything in Singapore has a purpose. This brutally pragmatic mindset may take its toll on the local population, but it also creates an extremely efficient and clean city. The standard of living is extremely high...

As an melting pot of cultures, the food in Singapore is insurmountable. The local delicacies such as bak kut teh and Hainanese chicken rice are to die for. The selection is vast, and even the pickiest eaters will find something to satisfy their hunger (it might take a bit of trial and error, though).

Lastly, Singapore is the perfect base from which to explore the entirety of Southeast Asia. You can find flights to nearby cities for as little as $50USD, with most destination costing no more than $200USD. Singapore's Changi Airport is extremely efficient and clean, and offers amenities such as theatres and sleeping areas for transiting passengers. Being in the top airport in the world at the beginning and end of a trip is...

While Singapore has a lot to offer exchange students, it isn't perfect. I would offer up two warnings that may be dealbreakers for some: First, if your idea of a good time is imbibing illicit substances, Singapore is not the place for you. Drug smuggling is a serious offence in Singapore, and punishments range from caning to imprisonment and death by hanging. Alcohol is available, but it is heavily taxed (although ladies can get free drinks from bars and clubs on Wednesdays). Second, the weather is hot and humid all year long, and those who cannot handle high temperatures should be warned. Most dormitory rooms are not air conditioned, but fans are available, and bamboo or woven grass mats work wonders.

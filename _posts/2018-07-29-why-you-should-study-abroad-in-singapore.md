My parents earned their Masters degrees at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. I was born at the Singapore General Hospital in 1998, but I moved away before I was old enough to remember. Thus, when it came to deciding where to study abroad, my decision was easy. Singapore has a world-class education system, and my personal connection to the country was undeniable. 

After my semester there, I realize that Singapore is the perfect study abroad destination...

A city and nation, Singapore is extremely small. While that can be a little boring, there are still countless things to do. The public transportation system is excellent and extremely affordable, so most locations are usually no more than half an hour away. 

Everything in Singapore has a purpose. This brutally pragmatic mindset may take its toll on the local population, but it also creates an extremely efficient and clean city. The standard of living is extremely high...

As an melting pot of cultures, the food in Singapore is insurmountable. The local delicacies such as bak kut teh and Hainanese chicken rice are to die for. The selection is vast, and even the pickiest eaters will find something to satisfy their hunger (it might take a bit of trial and error, though).

Lastly, Singapore is the perfect base from which to explore the entirety of Southeast Asia. You can find flights to nearby cities for as little as $50USD, with most destination costing no more than $200USD. Singapore's Changi Airport is extremely efficient and clean, and offers amenities such as theatres and sleeping areas for transiting passengers. Being in the top airport in the world at the beginning and end of a trip is...

While Singapore has a lot to offer exchange students, it isn't perfect. I would offer up two warnings that may be dealbreakers for some: First, if your idea of a good time is imbibing illicit substances, Singapore is not the place for you. Drug smuggling is a serious offence in Singapore, and punishments range from caning to imprisonment and death by hanging. Alcohol is available, but it is heavily taxed (although ladies can get free drinks from bars and clubs on Wednesdays). Second, the weather is hot and humid all year long, and those who cannot handle high temperatures should be warned. Most dormitory rooms are not air conditioned, but fans are available, and bamboo or woven grass mats work wonders.

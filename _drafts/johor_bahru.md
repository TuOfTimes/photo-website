# Johor Bahru, Malaysia

## Introduction
Johor Bahru was the first trip I made after arriving in Singapore in January. It was a very affordable trip and a good primer for seeing the rest of the country. The city isn't particularly exciting but cheap food and drinks can make for a fun weekend.

## Transportation
My friends and I took public transportation from Singapore to JB. Regardless of where in Singapore you start, the recommendation is to take the MRT to Woodlands station on the North South Line, then take the 913 bus to the Woodlands Checkpoint. Once there, go through Singapore customs and hop on any bus to get across the bridge, then pass through Malaysian customs. Depending on the time of day, the border crossing may take anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours. Malaysian customs are located right in Johor Bahru, so once through you can walk or take a Grab to your destination. Getting around the city is fairly affordable, as Grab prices are low. A 10 minute ride will cost about 10 RM or 2.50 USD.

## What to Do

### Eat
Hawker food in Singapore is cheap, but it's even cheaper in Johor. When I visited we ate at various establishments on the streets that we walked on. I would recommend eating where the crowds are, because the locals always know best. These places are generally not upscale at all, but they have lots of character and make great food. Don't be afraid to explore! Night markets are also a great place to get food.

### Drink
Alcohol in Singapore is heavily taxed, and is thus prohibitively expensive. Across the border in Malaysia, the taxes are much lighter, so... There is a duty free shopping center about 20 minutes away from the Malaysian immigrations checkpoint in Johor, which can be easily reached via Grab. There, we found a variety of beers and hard liquors for similar prices to what you'd find in the States. For example, a 1 L bottle of Smirnoff vodka cost about 69 RM, and beers were about 4 RM for a can, give or take. While I would recommend that you bring alcohol back to Singapore from other countries, keep in mind that there is no duty free allowance when entering Singapore from Malaysia. 

### Explore
There aren't many big tourist attractions in Johor, but like any new location, it can be fun to do some simple exploring. Here are some of the more interesting things we encountered:

#### Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Glass Temple
There is a very neat temple called the Glass Temple that I would suggest visiting. It's within walking distance of the Malaysian immigrations checkpoint, but in hot weather I would recommend one take a Grab. A narrow road around some buildings brings you to the ornate temple, which isn't particularly large but quite detailed.


#### Night Market
Where Singapore has Hawker centers and established stores, Johor Bahru (and most of Southeast Asia) have night markets. These markets are one of my favorite attractions because they feel very local and have lots of great food and shopping to offer. There was a large market right outside our AirBNB that offered fresh fruit, street food, counterfeit goods, and much more. The market stretched for many blocks and was quite lively until 2 am.

#### Johor Bahru Zoo
Not the greatest zoo, but for 2 RM it's worth a visit to see some animals.

#### Flower Markets
